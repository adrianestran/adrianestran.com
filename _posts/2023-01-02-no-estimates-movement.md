I have a few strategies for how I would work to keep a top performer engaged. I believe the success of each strategy can be greatly improved if I have developed a deep, personal understanding of who the engineer is, their history, and where they hope to go. 
<br>
<br>

#### 1. Motivations
Fairly obvious to say - I believe it starts with understanding what motivates the engineer now, and which past experiences, either personally or professionally, have shaped those motivations.

I also want to continuously analyse those motivations with the engineer over time. Our motivations can evolve unconsciously, and a more accurate and nuanced picture can develop when we challenge ourselves to re-visit the topic with a reflective mind.

#### 2. Values
I treat values as distinct from motivations, and I want to give equal importance to understanding and analysing an engineer's values. These will almost certainly evolve, and changes in an engineer's values may have a big impact on their happiness.

Prompting engineers to reflect on their values from time to time can help them to get clearer on what is important to them.

#### 3. Goals
The third collection of data points I want to collect from an engineer is their concrete goals. Strategies for how to help an engineer identify and set goals is a topic for another post, but having clarity around their motivations and values will also be of benefit when setting goals.

Several factors will influence which strategies are available to keep a top performer motivated. For example:

+ Company culture
    * Is individual well-being a core value of the company? 
    * Is lateral mobility encouraged?
    * Are learning and development a priority? Is there a budget for this?
+ Company size
    * There may be fewer opportunities to motivate a high performer in a smaller company
+ Company flexibility
    * Are In-band salary increases available?
    * Is there a flexible holiday policy?
<br>
<br>

#### Recognition
Although appropriate recognition should be given to any team member with good performance, paying special attention to the recognition given to top performers may go some way to keeping them motivated. I may even ask an engineer to tell me how they prefer their achievements to be recognised.

Some ideas for how I might elevate the recognition for a top performer include:

+ Recognise their efforts in front of a broad audience
+ In-band salary increase
+ Additional holiday allowance
+ Increased L&D budget
+ Personalised perks, such as custom one-off company swag 
+ A voucher for their favourite eatery

As already stated, the options regarding recognition will often be dictated by the company we are working for.

#### Mobility  
[Research](https://www.i4cp.com/surveys/talent-mobility-matters)  on talent mobility shows that proactively moving employees into different roles can be one of the most underutilized, yet most effective, development and cultural enhancement techniques in companies today. 

Giving my high performers greater flexibility to choose their roles can be a great motivator. This again is a company mindset and may be influenced by the size and stage of the company. I believe it is much harder for a small start-up of 50-100 people to offer mobility, even to top performers, as it may cause too much disruption.

Workload
High performers typically stand out because they're efficient and get a lot done. When a new priority task pops up I may be tempted to assign these to those who I know will do the best work. But this pattern repeated can lead to high performers being overburdened. 

I want to ensure that I'm distributing high-priority tasks so that those senior people aren't tackling all of the high-stakes work.
<br>
<br>
#### Growth
It may be useful to have more frequent conversations with high performers about their growth. These individuals are often highly motivated by growth and progress. I want to demonstrate to them that I am not only concerned about the progress they are making on projects, but also their career progress. 

I want to be regularly reflecting on these growth conversations, and be formulating a plan for how I can support them. This may involve looking for new challenges inside or outside of the team.
<br>
<br>
#### Feedback
This strategy follows on from the previous. In order to support the growth of an engineer I want to be giving them frequent feedback on how they are performing and how they have developed over time. Strategies for how to deliver feedback is a big topic, and I hope to one day compile my thoughts on this topic.
<br>
<br>
#### Purpose
The final strategy which I believe can be useful is talking to high performers about the difference their work is making to the company, their peers or with customers out in the real world. I believe most engineers want to work on things that matter, and I think I can keep them motivated if I can take the day-to-day tasks of the team and connect them to the orginaizational or business impact.
