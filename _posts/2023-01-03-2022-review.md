>“Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity. This is one reason why meaningful change does not require radical change. Small habits can make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a new identity. And if a change is meaningful, it is actually big. That's the paradox of making small improvements.” - James Clear._

I have not read [Atomic Habits](https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299), but this wisdom from the book really struck me, and I drew a lot of energy from it through 2022. I am happy with the person I am today, and I have _mostly_ *luck* to thank for that. I was lucky when the genetic cards were shuffled. I was lucky to be born into a developed society. I was lucky to have loving parents. I was extremely lucky to be smart enough to do moderately well in school, and to have a work ethic that has allowed me to build a career.  

I'm not sure exactly where I get off the determinsm bus, but certainly close to the final stop. It is in those final miles where I try to postively influence my macro and micro decision making towards the person I wish to become.

In the spirit of small incremental changes, I will try develop a writing habit. My goal is to get better at expressing myself in written form. I thought I would start with something simple - my 2022 review.
