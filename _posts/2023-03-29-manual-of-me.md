---
A Manual of Me is a document that attempts to explain my working style. It outlines not what I do, *but how I do it*. 

It is my intention to share these insights in the hope of dispelling any assumptions people may form regarding my working style, thereby increasing the likelihood of our collaborative efforts being more productive.

Communication and collaboration styles vary between individuals; it is important to acknowledge and understand these differences to prevent any potential misunderstandings. This is particularly important in situations where remote and multicultural communication is involved.

I acknowledge that this content is not a complete representation of my working style and that it will continue to develop and change as I gain more experience, receive feedback, and mature as a person.

If you‚Äôre curious, this concept was [popularised](https://growth.eladgil.com/book/the-role-of-the-ceo/insights-working-with-claire/) by Claire Hughes Johnson, COO @ Stripe

{% include elements/header-3-blue.html text="Communication" %}
---

##### General
* My communication style might be called direct and straightforward; I strive to articulate my thoughts and ideas in an unambigious manner.
* When I see an ellipsis (‚Ä¶) at the end of a message, I often infer a passive-aggressive or sarcastic tone.
* If I am typing during a meeting it‚Äôs most often because I am taking digital notes.
* Unless I‚Äôm not in an appropriate venue, I always have my camera turned on during video calls.

 
##### Slack
* I prefer asynchronous communication via Slack.
* I do not anticipate immediate responses to my messages, and in situations where urgency is of concern, I will make an effort to communicate the urgency of the matter.
* In the event of delayed responses, it is typically due to my attention being directed towards another task, attending a meeting, or taking the necessary time to thoroughly contemplate and formulate my reply. 
* If it‚Äôs a long topic and not time-sensitive, I would prefer discussing in a 1:1 call.
* I try as much as possible to stay away from Slack after work hours.
* On occasion, you may receive a message from me outside of typical work hours. This is likely because I have had an idea that I wished to preserve and avoid forgetting.
* I‚Äôm selective in my use of emojis. You will rarely see me use the ü§£ emoji, but I may use many üòÄ and ü§™  emojis.
* I tend not to engage in extensive small talk when communicating through Slack, preferring to address the matter at hand.

###### General
* My primary objective is to act in the best interests of the team, which encompasses the well-being and advancement of each team member, as well as the team's ability to successfully contribute to the organization's objectives.
* I am committed to facilitating a healthy work-life balance for all members of the team.


###### 1:1s
* Building personal connections with individuals is important to me, and therefore, during our scheduled 1:1 meetings, I may choose to dedicate a portion of our time to share personal anecdotes or stories.
* I make every effort to avoid cancelling or rescheduling our scheduled 1:1 meetings unless it is imperative or if we have mutually determined that there is no pressing topic to discuss.
* In my view, 1:1 meetings should be reserved for topics that are beyond the scope of our daily work, such as providing feedback, discussing goals, sharing personal sentiments, and any other matters that are relevant to our working relationship. They are not for status updates.

<br>

<br>

* I enjoy lively and dynamic collaboration, which entails exploring and analyzing a range of options, engaging in decision-making discussions, and soliciting input from individuals with relevant experience.
* I am not averse to engaging in healthy debate or constructive conflict, so long as it is grounded in trust and mutual respect. In my experience, reasoned and robust debate can lead to identifying the best solution.
* While I highly esteem objectivity, I also recognize the value of intuition in certain situations. When my intuition strongly suggests a course of action, I may rely on it alongside objective analysis.
* I value data-driven decisions (assuming high confidence in the integrity and validity of the data).
* I consider goals to be a valuable aspect of our work, but I also recognize that establishing and maintaining effective systems is critical to achieving those objectives. To this end, I prefer to establish agreements on the processes and systems that we will utilize to work towards our goals, implement those systems, and adjust them as necessary based on our progress.
* In order to ensure that our meetings are productive and effective, I make an effort to provide a clear agenda and/or description of the purpose of the meeting, including the goal(s), when scheduling it.
* I am accustomed to commencing and concluding meetings at their scheduled times.
* I believe it is important to appreciate and advocate for the subtleties and complexities that exist within our work, but it is also crucial to recognize when excessive nuance may impede progress or understanding.

{% include elements/header-3-blue.html text="Blindspots" %}
---

Human beings are complex creatures. We might think we know ourselves and have a sense of how we come across to others, but it‚Äôs extraordinarily difficult to peer into those areas hidden from us, obscured by our strengths and masked by our ignorance. However, those blind spots that elude our awareness may be readily apparent to others. As such, I humbly request that you provide me with feedback if you observe me behaving in a manner that you believe does not serve me well.

* I make a conscious effort to give people the benefit of the doubt and assume their good intentions. However, I have learned from past experiences where my trust was misplaced and should have been more discerning and critically evaluated their motives or agenda."
* I have been known to be too decisive - making decisions and taking action too quickly, without consulting with enough people to gather feedback and opinions. 
* In the past I have taken too long to act on low performance, spending too much time hoping that things would improve. Hope is not a strategy, and I now try to act much more decisively. I believe that my responsibility is first and foremost, the health of the team, and ignoring low performance shirks that responsibility.
* I used to prioritize finding the perfect process, and I was known as a process czar. However, I now understand that clarity and simplicity are more important.

<br>
<br>

{% include elements/header-3-blue.html text="Feedback" %}
---

* When receiving feedback, I approach it with an open mind and assume positive intent. I believe that feedback is essential for growth and development, and I welcome it in any form.
* I prefer direct feedback. Don‚Äôt feel the need to sugarcoat.
* I will strive to provide feedback in a timely manner.
* If I deliver constructive feedback, I will try to provide suggestions for how to improve/grow in the specific area.
* If someone vents to me about you, I will encourage that person to speak to you directly.
* While I'm open to all ideas, it's important to me that you have a sense of ownership over your idea and have taken the time to consider how it will impact our team and its feasibility.

* My working style has been most influenced by my time spent working as a consultant in London.
* I am naturally an evening person, but with age, my patterns are shifting towards earlier mornings.
* *"Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress." ~ James Clear*. I have a strong affinity to this mantra.
* I am open; I don‚Äôt mind sharing more personal details about my life outside of work. Ask if you are curious about something.
* I‚Äôm happy to engage in small talk, and I‚Äôm even more enthusiastic about deep meaningful discussions about important topics.
* Example: Do we really have free will?
* I try to take regular 5-minute breaks between periods of intense focus.
