>“Many seem to have absolutely no awareness of how fortunate one must be to succeed at anything in life, no matter how hard one works. One must be lucky to be able to work. One must be lucky to be intelligent, physically healthy, and not bankrupted in middle age by the illness of a spouse. Consider the biography of any “self-made” man, and you will find that his success was entirely dependent on background conditions that he did not make and of which he was merely the beneficiary. There is not a person on earth who chose his genome, or the country of his birth, or the political and economic conditions that prevailed at moments crucial to his progress.” - Sam Harris.

I haven't settled on which version of deterministic philosophy I fully subscribe to, but I'm an enthusiastic student of this school of thought. 

Meditating on my past, both at a macro and micro level, it's easy to observe an endless stream of events produced by the universal good luck service. 

2022 was no different, and I will review my highlights & accomplishments of the year through this lens.

### **Family**
Very unexpectedly, the stars aligned in early 2022 and most of my extended family were suddenly on their way to the Canary Islands for a long overdue family reunion.

### **Friends**
After a long struggle, my closest friends gave birth to their first child. I look forward to meeting him in 2023.

### **Health**
I got through another year without any major health problems. I've been extremely luck through life to have avoided any significant health challenges; no broken bones, no surgeries and no unexpected test results. 

### **Work**
I continued to learn a lot about managing people and leading teams. Introducing process changes to a team is difficult, and needs to be done sensitively, and with the by-in from all team members.

In order to get that by-in, I needed to make a convincing case for what benefit the change would bring.

Once I had the confidence of the team, I needed to execute quickly. Org changes should not be dragged out.
