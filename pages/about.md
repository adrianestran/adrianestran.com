# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>

14 years of experience in software engineering; 8+ years contributing as an IC with a specialism in native mobile. I have spent the last 5 years growing and leading engineering and product teams in multiple domains including banking, fintech, public sector and consulting. 

I believe I am highly adaptable, with good business and technical acumen. I am passionate about nurturing and encouraging excellent engineering and team culture. Some of the values I hold high, and work to foster, include Trust, Sustainability, Impartiality and Ownership.

In pursuit of these values, I have developed various skills, including:
- Coaching, goal setting & feedback strategies
- Empathic leadership
- Communicating across cultures and geographies
- Collaborating across the business through all stages of product development
- Shaping predictable delivery systems 
- Pragmatically applying engineering best practise

My ideal role is a close-to-the-ground leadership position, solving technical, team and people challenges within a product organisation. 

Above all, culture is most important to me: working with a diverse group of people who are warm, friendly and outgoing. I prefer to bring my "whole self" to work.
