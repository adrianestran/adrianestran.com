# **About Me**

Hi, I'm AdrianðŸ‘‹ - an Engineering Manager with a passion for People-First Engineering Culture, Delivery Strategy, and Lean Product Development. Over my career, Iâ€™ve built and managed enterprise scale distributed systems across diverse industries, including FinTech, Government, E-Commerce, and B2B SaaS.

Iâ€™m currently one of 2 Engineering Managers for the B2B SaaS team at Treatwell, Europeâ€™s largest Hair and Beauty platform. I oversee a team of 7, building and operating the SaaS platform that serves 25,000 salons across Europe.

In my current role, my focus areas include Agile delivery, mentoring engineers, system design, fostering engineering culture, hiring, and incident management.

My ideal role is a close-to-the-ground leadership position, solving technical, team and people challenges within a product organisation. 

The work culture is the most crucial aspect for me, as I want to be part of a diverse and inclusive team. I am most productive when I can be myself, and I value an environment where everyone feels comfortable doing the same.
