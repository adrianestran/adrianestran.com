# **About Me**

My professional journey in software engineering spans 14 years, of which I have spent more than 8 years contributing as an IC with a specialization in native mobile development. Over the past 5 years, I have diversified my experience through leading engineering and product teams in multiple domains, including banking, fintech, public sector, and consulting.

I consider myself to be a highly adaptable individual with a strong blend of business and technical acumen. My passion lies in fostering a culture of excellence in engineering and team dynamics. As a leader, I prioritize values such as Trust, Sustainability and Ownership, which I work hard to instill in myself and others around me.

In pursuit of these values, I have developed skills and interests in the following areas:
- Developing reliable delivery systems
- Effectively communicating with individuals from diverse cultures and skill levels
- Implementing engineering and process best practices in a practical manner
- Fostering an engineering culture that promotes high-performance teams
- Collaborating seamlessly across various departments within the organization
- Utilizing contemporary recruitment practices
- Demonstrating empathetic leadership skills

My ideal role is a close-to-the-ground leadership position, solving technical, team and people challenges within a product organisation. 

The work culture is the most crucial aspect for me, as I want to be part of a diverse and inclusive team. I am most productive when I can be myself, and I value an environment where everyone feels comfortable doing the same.
