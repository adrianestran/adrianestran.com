# **About Me**

My professional journey in software engineering spans 14 years, out of which I have spent more than 8 years contributing as an IC with a specialization in native mobile development. Over the past 5 years, I have diversified my experience by leading engineering and product teams in multiple domains, including banking, fintech, public sector, and consulting.

I consider myself to be a highly adaptable individual with a strong blend of business and technical acumen. My passion lies in fostering a culture of excellence in engineering and team dynamics. As a leader, I prioritize values such as Trust, Sustainability and Ownership, which I work hard to instill in myself and others around me.

In pursuit of these values, I have developed skills in the following areas:
- Coaching, goal setting & feedback strategies
- Empathic leadership
- Communicating across cultures and geographies
- Working collaboratively across different departments of the business throughout all stages of product development.
- Shaping predictable delivery systems 
- Pragmatically applying engineering best practise

My ideal role is a close-to-the-ground leadership position, solving technical, team and people challenges within a product organisation. 

What matters to me the most is the work culture, where I can collaborate with a diverse and welcoming group of individuals. I believe in bringing my authentic self to work and thrive in an environment where everyone can do the same.
